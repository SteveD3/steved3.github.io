### New Year - New website
In December of 2020, I did something I haven't really done for a long time. I took the month of December off. Thing is, after a week, I needed something to do. So what I decided on was part research, and part education. I started development on [Kit Hunter 2.0](https://github.com/SteveD3/kit_hunter "Kit Hunter is my attempt to learn Python. Click the link to visit version 1.0 of the project on GitHub."), and started collecting and analyzing phishing kits throughout the month. In addition, I turned my attention to GitHub and decided I would learn how to manage the tool on a wider scale.

What you're seeing is the result of that goal. Kit Hunter development is ongoing, but showing promising results. However, this website is going to be a portal of sorts where I can write about things that aren't really something that should go on [Technical Outcast](https://TechnicalOutcast.com "TechnicalOutcast is the home of my podcast of the same name."). Essentially, if it is too much for Twitter, or isn't related to the mission of Technical Outcast, then it will go here. Also, this website will be the home of all of my Kit Hunter research, as well as other related phishing topics, but I'll leave the existing content on Technical Outcast as is.

I'll aim to keep this domain updated as things develop or an idea hits my mind. If you have comments, questions, or just want to get in touch, check the About page.
