<img style="float: right; margin:1em;" src="/images/Steve-Square-Twitter-sm.jpg"> Before joining the journalism world in 2005, I spent 15 years doing consulting and freelance contracting within the IT space. My main focus was on infrastructure management and security.

My journalism career lasted for more than a decade. I was privileged to work with lots of talented writers and editors at several news organizations. I was even fortunate enough to win multiple awards for my work. But I needed a change.

After leaving journalism in 2018, I started working with a well-known, but otherwise unnamed security company doing threat research and publications. Honestly, I like being back in the security industry. Despite the ups and downs, it's a rewarding and challenging experience. I'm a father of two, grandfather of two, current host of TechnicalOutcast, and a former co-host of the Southern Fried Security Podcast. If you want to know more, just get in touch.
