<img style="float: right; margin:1em;" src="/images/Steve-Square-Twitter.jpg"> Before joining the journalism world in 2005, Steve spent 15 years doing consulting work and freelance contracting within the IT space, focusing on infrastructure management and security.

A journalist for more than a decade, Steve helped start and run The Tech Herald, contributed to Slashdot, and wrote daily news for Security Week. In addition, he spent five years as the Senior Staff Writer at CSO Online. While at CSO Online, in addition to his daily news assignments, Steve ran the publication’s flagship security news blog: Salted Hash, where he won multiple awards for his work.

After leaving journalism, Steve is now working with a well-known, but otherwise unnamed security company doing threat research and publications. He’s a father of two, grandfather of two, current host of TechnicalOutcast, and a former co-host of the Southern Fried Security Podcast.
