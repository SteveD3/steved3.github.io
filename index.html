<p>Welcome to my little personal portal. This website is unrelated to [TechnicalOutcast](https://TechnicalOutcast.com "TechnicalOutcast is the home of my podcast"), and will be used to discuss research, life, or anything else that comes to mind.</p>
<p>Mostly, this domain will be used for things that are just too long for Twitter, but not exactly something that would go on the other domain.</p>
<p>Checkout the links below for the most recent articles.</p>
