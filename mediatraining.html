				<h1 id="the-rules-for-speaking-to-the-media">The rules for speaking to the media</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>You might not know it, but there are rules for speaking to the press. Sometimes, the best rule is to not speak to the press. Odd, seeing that advice come from a journalist huh? But it&#39;s true. If you&#39;re not prepared, speaking to the press is the last thing you should do, because once you&#39;ve said something you can&#39;t take it back.</p>
				<p>The other day on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/Mantia/status/1013559718759956481" target="_blank">a user posted an interesting question</a>: &quot;What&#39;s something that seems obvious within your profession, but the general public seems to misunderstand?&quot;</p>
				<p>It&#39;s a great question, at least for me, because there are several misunderstood areas of journalism. My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/dabir/status/1013988801104891904" target="_blank">responded to that question</a> with a fact about &quot;off the record&quot; conversations.</p>
				<p>The response he got though, as you can see in link, is scary. The person responding cited the <a href="https://www.openschoolofjournalism.com/resources/encyclopedia/off-the-record" target="_blank">open school of journalism</a> and said that off record conversations &quot;...can be used in the article as long as it is not credited to the source.&quot;</p>
				<p>Not only is that not true, believing such can have disastrous effects. <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveD3/status/1014030060649631744" target="_blank">I made my own remarks on Twitter</a>, but part of the reason I set this GitHub up was to address the misconception about off record conversations with greater detail.</p>
				<p>So with that said, here are some rules for speaking to the press. Some of the things I&#39;m going to share will seem strange, given I&#39;m a member of the media myself, but I like to play fair. And I&#39;m not the only one.</p>
				<h2 id="assume-that-everything-is-on-the-record">Assume that everything is on the record</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Unless there is an agreement before the conversation starts, and I mean conversation, not just an interview, assume that everything you say to a member of the press is on the record.</p>
				<p>You do so, not because the press is out to get you, but because life is easier when you just run with that train of thought. Off record conversations are fine, background conversations too, but you shouldn&#39;t say something unless you are willing to see it as a headline in the paper.</p>
				<p>If it isn&#39;t clear, an on the record conversation with a journalist means that anything you say can be used, quoted, and attributed to you in a story should the journalist chose to do one.</p>
				<p>Journalists are people. As such, there are good ones, bad ones, and some stuck in the middle. Thus, you may find a journalist who promises never to mention something you&#39;ve shared, and then they do it anyway.</p>
				<p>Relationships matter. They&#39;re important to journalists, and we <del>value</del> treasure them greatly. If you have a strong relationship with a journalist, and you&#39;re comfortable with going off the record with them, do so. But relationships are earned, and they take time to forge. Off record conversations are not something to take lightly.</p>
				<p>The majority of working journalists would <strong>never</strong> burn a source intentionally, and using remarks that were given off the record in confidence would instantly burn the source. However, as mentioned, journalists are people too, and so bad apples exist.</p>
				<h2 id="so-what-is-an-off-the-record-conversation-">So what is an off the record conversation?</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>It&#39;s important to remember that when a journalist comes to you for an interview, they&#39;re supposed to identify themselves as journalists, and give you an idea of the story they&#39;re working on. If you&#39;ve ever had any experience dealing with the media, this process will ring some bells.</p>
				<p>When the introductions are over, this is where the rules of the conversation / interview are set. Ask if the discussion is on the record or off the record (assuming you&#39;re comfortable going off the record).</p>
				<p>If you and the journalist agree that the conversation is off the record, then nothing you say can be used by the journalist in a story. Nothing. At. All. They can&#39;t quote you, and they can&#39;t take information you share and place it in a story without naming you. Again, anything you say or share off the record is off limits.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>BUT... and this is important... the journalist is free to take anything you say or share to other sources and try and get them to confirm it on the record. They will do this. It&#39;s their job to do so. They won't name you as the source of the informaion they're shopping around (it's bad form to do so really), but they will look for on record sources.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Sometimes conversations can take time, so feel free to reconfirm the rules, and make sure you&#39;re still off the record. If you&#39;re uncomfortable with the direction the conversation is taking, feel free to end it at any time.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Please remember, you <strong>CANNOT</strong> say something and then claim it is off the record. It doesn&#39;t work that way. This is why it is so important to set the rules first, before the conversation happens.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<h2 id="so-what-is-an-on-background-conversation-">So what is an on background conversation?</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>On background conversations are really common. Most of the conversations I have with people at most conferences (Black Hat, BSides, DEF CON, RSA, etc.) are on background.</p>
				<p>These conversations mean that the journalist can use what you&#39;ve said or shared, but they cannot name you as the source. You may sometimes hear this as <em>not for attribution</em>.</p>
				<p>Again, this is something you&#39;ll need to agree to before the conversation starts. As mentioned, you can&#39;t say something and then after the fact claim it was on background or off the record.</p>
				<p>Background conversations are relationship builders. In a way, you can use them to test reporters and see how they handle the information you&#39;ve shared. For example, if you share something on background and they quote you, that probably isn&#39;t a reporter you want to speak with in the future.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>By the way, not for attribution conversations are exactly like the name suggests; the information shared can be used and even quoted, but the source of the information isn&#39;t named.</p>
				<p>When you see these conversations used in the media, the source is often cited as &quot;senior officials&quot; or &quot;sources close to the investigation&quot;</p>
				</blockquote>
				<h2 id="not-everyone-will-agree-rules-matter">Not everyone will agree... rules matter</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Now that the basics are outlined, there are a few other details to consider. First, not every journalist will agree to go off the record, or even on background. Our job is to get people on record and inform the public. Sometimes, our editors (bosses) will not allow background or non-attributable sources. Again, this is why getting the rules outlined at the start is so very important, it will save you from headaches down the line.</p>
				<p>Also, you&#39;re allowed to make conditionals - such as paraphrasing your statements and requiring that you aren&#39;t named directly - but again, the journalist has to agree with you before you share any information or make statements.</p>
				<p><strong>You can&#39;t say something first and then try to apply rules to it after the fact.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Remember, unless the journalist agrees, and you've heard this confirmation, you are not on background or off the record. The journalist has to agree.</strong></p>
				<h2 id="want-to-see-more-have-questions-">Want to see more? Have questions?</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>So this was mostly a mini-rant because there was more to the topic than 240 characters on Twitter would allow, and the message would be lost in a thread. If it was useful, feel free to ping me (<a href="https://twitter.com/SteveD3/" target="_blank">@SteveD3</a>) and let me know. But more importantly, if you have questions you&#39;d like me to discuss. Ask. My job gets easier when the people I interview understand how the media works and how to deal with journalists.</p>
